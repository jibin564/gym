# gym
Hi,
I am excited to share my foundational gym website project, built entirely using Angular, HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. This project serves as a practical demonstration of my front-end development skills and the effective use of the Angular framework. I am committed to its continuous improvement and plan to implement frequent weekly updates here on GitHub, adding new features and refining the user experience. Follow along to see the progress!
